# DoubleLinkedList
The goal of this class project was to create a generic doubly linked list from scratch. The list has eight methods:

size - Returns the list's size.
insert - Adds a new element to the list at the specified position.
append - Adds a new element at the end of the list.
get - Returns an element from the list.
delete - Deletes an element.
toString - Returns the list in a String format.
inList - Checks to see if a certain element is contained in the list.
