# DoubleLinkedList
The goal of this class project was to create a generic doubly linked list from scratch. 

# Functionality
Elements can be inserted in any position in the list, appended to the end of the list, or deleted from any position. Any element's value can be accessed. The list's size can also be accessed. An inList method checks to see if a certain element is contained in the list. A toString method returns the contents of the list in the form of a String.
